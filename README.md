# Welcome to the carrievrtis.com repo.

###### This is intended primarily for reference purposes, but you're free to use any parts of it that you may want as you see fit.

[Carrievrtis.com](https://www.carrievrtis.com) is my personal portfolio website, built with:

* A Node.js/Express backend deployed as a load-balanced Docker swarm.
* A Pug and Sass-based front end.
* A bit of jQuery, too - to make the magic happen.
